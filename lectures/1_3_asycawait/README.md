# Dart Async Mini-Lesson Pack (Student Version)

This set of files and slides will help explain how Dart handles asynchronous programming step by step.  They are to be used as part of Lecture 1.3 in CS 1635.

## What’s Inside
- **starter/** – Dart files with TODOs for you to complete.  
- **solutions/** – Full reference solutions for every activity.  

---

## How to Use
Work through the activities in order. Each file builds on what you learned in the last one:

1. `1_basic_future.dart` – Learn the basics of Futures.  
2. `2_noawait_vs_await.dart` – See the difference between using `await` and not using it.  
3. `3_future_wait_parallel.dart` – Run multiple Futures in parallel with `Future.wait`.  
4. `4_stream_basic.dart` – Get started with Streams.  
5. `5_fake_api_sequential.dart` – Practice handling tasks one after the other.  
6. `6_error_handling.dart` – Learn how to catch and manage errors.  
7. `exercise_a_starter.dart` → Work it out yourself, then compare with `exercise_a_solution.dart`.  
8. `exercise_b_starter.dart` → Work it out yourself, then compare with `exercise_b_solution.dart`.  
9. `exercise_c_starter.dart` → Work it out yourself, then compare with `exercise_c_solution.dart`.  
10. `capstone_starter.dart` → Bring it all together, then review `capstone_solution.dart`.

## Running the Examples
All files are plain Dart. Run them from the terminal with:

```bash
dart run <file.dart>
