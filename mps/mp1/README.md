# Big JSON, Smooth UI (Flutter)

This sample downloads a **large JSON** and parses it **off the main thread** using `compute()`,
so the UI spinner stays smooth. Toggle to compare "main-thread parse" vs "background isolate".

## Quick start
```bash
flutter pub get
# If platform folders are missing:
# flutter create .
flutter run
```
